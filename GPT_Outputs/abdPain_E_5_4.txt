
Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Abdominal Pain

Dear Parents,

Your child has been examined for belly (abdominal) pain. Here are the instructions to help your child get better at home:

Medicine

Pain relief: You may give over-the-counter pain relief medicine like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) as directed on the bottle. Never give your child aspirinâ€”it can cause serious illness.

Prescription medicines: If your doctor gave a prescription, get it filled right away and use it as told.

Diet

Drink plenty: Ensure your child drinks lots of water or other clear fluids. This can help if the pain is because of things like gas or constipation.

Soft foods: Start with bland, easy-to-digest foods like rice, bananas, toast, or applesauce. As your child feels better, you can slowly add other foods.

Rest

Make sure your child gets plenty of rest. It helps the body heal.

Follow-up Care

Doctor's visit: Make a follow-up appointment with your child's doctor within the week or as advised.

Symptoms check: If your child's pain gets worse, returns after getting better, or if new symptoms appear (like throwing up, fever, blood in poop, severe pain, or weight loss), call the doctor right away.

At Home Activities

Light activity is good. Your child should not do hard play or sports until the doctor says it's okay.

What to Remember

Belly pain can have many reasons. It may take time and maybe more tests to find out why your child hurts.

Even if the exact reason is not known, most belly pains get better by themselves with rest, fluids, and simple foods.

You know your child best. If you feel something is wrong, seek medical help.

We wish your child a quick recovery. If you have any questions or need help, call the clinic or the doctor's office.

Thank you,
[Your Healthcare Provider]
