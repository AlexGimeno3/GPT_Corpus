
Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Asthma

Dear Parent(s) or Guardian(s),

Your child has been diagnosed with asthma, a condition that affects the lungs. This can cause problems with breathing, but don't worry, it's manageable. Here are the key instructions you need to follow:

Understand Asthma Triggers: Asthma triggers are things that can start or "trigger" an asthma attack. Common triggers are dust, mold, pet dander, smoke, cold air, exercise, and respiratory infections. Each child may have different triggers. Know what triggers your child's asthma and try to keep them away from these things.

Follow the Asthma Action Plan: We have created a specific asthma action plan for your child. This includes when and how to use medicines. The plan is color-coded: green (doing well), yellow (getting worse), and red (medical help needed). Follow this plan carefully.

Medications: Asthma has two main types of medicines. Controller medicines help prevent attacks. They're taken daily, even when your child feels fine. The second type, quick-relief or "rescue" medicines, help during an asthma attack to make breathing easier.

Inhaler Use: If your child uses an inhaler, make sure they use it correctly. They should breathe in slowly as they press down on the inhaler, then hold their breath for about 10 seconds. Spacers, which are tube-like devices, can help with this. Clean the inhaler regularly as directed.

Look for Warning Signs: Keep an eye out for signs that your child's asthma is getting worse. These might include coughing more often, trouble breathing, waking up at night due to coughing or trouble breathing, or needing to use their quick-relief inhaler more than usual.

Emergency Situation: If your child's quick-relief medicine doesn't help, or if they're struggling to breathe, can't speak in full sentences, or their lips or fingernails turn blue, get medical help immediately. These are signs of a severe asthma attack.

Regular Check-ups: Regular doctor visits are crucial for monitoring your child's asthma. These appointments allow adjustments to their treatment plan if needed.

Healthy Lifestyle: Encourage your child to live a healthy lifestyle. This includes regular physical activity (unless it's a trigger), a balanced diet, and a good night's sleep. Keep your home smoke-free, and reduce allergens where possible.

Remember, asthma can be controlled and your child can live a normal, active life. Reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns about your child's condition.

Wishing your child good health,
