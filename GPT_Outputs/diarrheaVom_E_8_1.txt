Dear Parent(s) or Guardian(s),

We understand it's tough when your child is unwell. Your child was diagnosed with diarrhea and vomiting, and now you're headed home. Here are some instructions to help your child get better.

Fluids are key: Dehydration is a risk with diarrhea and vomiting. Offer small sips of water or oral rehydration solutions (like Pedialyte). Start with a teaspoon every 5 minutes, gradually increasing as tolerated. Avoid fruit juices, soda, or sports drinks as they can worsen diarrhea.

Food matters: Once vomiting has stopped, begin with bland foods. Try the BRAT diet (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast) for the first 24 hours. Slowly reintroduce normal foods over the next few days.

Rest: Your child's body needs energy to fight off the illness. Make sure they get plenty of sleep. Keep them home from school or childcare until they're symptom-free for at least 24 hours.

Medications: Don't give your child over-the-counter (OTC) medications for diarrhea or vomiting unless directed by a healthcare provider. Some can be harmful. If a prescription was given, use it exactly as directed.

Prevent spread: Diarrhea and vomiting can be contagious. Teach your child to wash hands often, especially after using the toilet and before eating. Clean surfaces in your home frequently.

Monitor symptoms: Keep an eye on signs of dehydration, such as dry mouth, no tears when crying, or not peeing for 8 hours. Watch for worsening symptoms like high fever, severe belly pain, bloody diarrhea, or if your child can't keep fluids down.

Follow-Up: Schedule a follow-up appointment with your child's healthcare provider in a week, or sooner if your child isn't improving.

Remember, if symptoms get worse, your child becomes very drowsy or unresponsive, or you're worried, seek medical help immediately. You know your child best. Trust your instincts.

Take care,
