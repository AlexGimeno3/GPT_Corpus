
Dear Parents/Guardians,

We're sending your child home now. They had a fever, which means their body was a bit warmer than usual. This often happens when our bodies are fighting off germs. Here are some things you should do to take care of your child at home:

Keep your child comfortable: Dress them in light clothing. Too many layers can make a fever worse. Make sure the room is a comfy temperatureâ€”not too hot or too cold.

Give them plenty of liquids: This helps keep your child from getting dehydrated. Water, soup, or juice are good choices. Avoid sodas or other drinks with a lot of sugar.

Rest is best: Sleep can help the body heal. Let your child rest as much as they want.

Medicine: If your child is feeling really uncomfortable, you can give them medicine like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). Always use the right amount for your child's weight and age.

Here's when you should call the doctor or nurse:

If your child is younger than 3 months and has a fever of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
If your child is between 3 months to 3 years and has a fever above 102.2 F (39 C).
If your child is older than 3 years and the fever lasts more than 3 days or goes above 104 F (40 C).
If your child has other symptoms like a stiff neck, severe headache, severe sore throat, severe ear pain, an unexplained rash, or repeated vomiting or diarrhea.
If your child seems very sleepy, won't eat or drink, or acts differently than usual.
Remember, a fever is usually just a sign that your child's body is working hard to get rid of germs. With some rest and the right care, your child should start feeling better soon.

Take care,
