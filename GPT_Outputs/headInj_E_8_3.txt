Condition: Minor Head Injury (No Concussion)

Dear [Parent's Name],

Your child has had a small bump to the head. After a thorough check-up, we're happy to say that it's a minor injury and there's no sign of a concussion. Still, it's important to watch your child closely over the next 24-48 hours to make sure no symptoms develop. Here's what you need to do:

1. Rest and Recovery:

Encourage your child to rest for the rest of the day. They can play gently, but avoid rough play or sports for a few days.
2. Pain Management:

If your child has a headache or is in pain, over-the-counter pain medicine like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can help. Follow the package instructions for dosage based on your child's weight and age.
3. Head Bump Care:

Apply a cold pack to the bump on the head to reduce swelling. Wrap ice or a pack of frozen peas in a towel and gently hold it against the bump for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours, as needed.
Monitor Your Child For Signs of Trouble:

While your child likely will be just fine, watch for these signs over the next 24-48 hours:

Headache that gets worse or doesn't go away with pain medication.
Nausea or vomiting.
Difficulty waking up or excessive sleepiness.
Trouble walking or talking.
Confusion or changes in personality.
Seizures or twitching.
Clear or bloody fluid from the ears or nose.
If you notice any of these symptoms, call us immediately or take your child to the emergency room. These could be signs of a more serious injury.

Follow-Up Care:

There's no need for a follow-up visit unless your child develops new symptoms or their condition worsens. However, feel free to contact us if you have any concerns or questions.

Remember, most minor head bumps are not serious, but it's essential to keep a close eye on your child. Your attention can help ensure a smooth recovery.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you need further information or if you have any concerns. We're here to help!

Wishing your child a swift recovery,
