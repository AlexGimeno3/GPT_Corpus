Dear Parents or Guardians,

Your child was recently treated for an asthma attack. Here are some steps to help manage your child's asthma at home.

Medication Use: Your child may have received a few types of medicine. Inhalers are usually used daily to prevent symptoms, while nebulizer treatments are used for quick relief when symptoms get worse. Make sure to use them as directed by the doctor.

Recognize Triggers: Asthma attacks can be caused by things called triggers, such as dust, smoke, pets, or even a cold. Pay attention to what might make your child's asthma worse and try to keep them away from these triggers.

Symptom Watch: Common symptoms include coughing, trouble breathing, chest tightness, and wheezing. If you see these symptoms getting worse, or if your child's medicines aren't helping, it might be a serious attack.

Asthma Action Plan: The doctor should have given you an asthma action plan. This plan explains what medicines to use, when to use them, and when to get help. Follow it carefully.

Follow-up Visit: Make sure to schedule and keep all follow-up appointments. Regular doctor visits are key to keeping your child's asthma under control.

Emergency Plan: If your child's symptoms quickly get very bad, this is an emergency. Call 911 or go to the nearest hospital right away.

Healthy Lifestyle: A healthy lifestyle helps control asthma. Make sure your child gets plenty of sleep, eats healthy food, and exercises regularly.

Remember, asthma can be managed effectively with your help.

Safety First: If your child is having difficulty breathing, their medication is not helping, or you feel it's an emergency, don't wait. Call 911 or go to the emergency room immediately.

Thank you for entrusting us with your child's care. We are here to support you, and we encourage you to call your child's doctor if you have any concerns or questions.
