
Dear Parents,

Your child had a head bump but, after careful examination, the doctor did not find signs of a concussion. Still, it's important you look after your child over the next few days. Here's how to care for your child at home.

Rest and relax: Even if it's not a concussion, rest is crucial. Let your child take it easy for the next few days. Play, school, and sports can wait. Rest will help the body heal faster.

Ice the injury: Put a cold pack on the bump for 15 minutes every 2 hours. Remember to wrap the cold pack in a thin cloth to prevent the cold from hurting your child's skin.

Watch out for symptoms: For the next 2 days, keep a close eye on your child. Watch for things like headaches, vomiting, changes in behavior, trouble walking, talking, or seeing, or your child feeling very sleepy. If you notice any of these, call your doctor right away.

Pain relief: If your child has a headache, you can give them over-the-counter pain medicine like acetaminophen (Tylenol). Do not give aspirin. If you're unsure, ask your pharmacist or doctor for help.

Avoid risky activities: Keep your child away from bike rides, climbing, or sports for a while. These could lead to another head injury before the first one has healed.

Healing time: Every child is different. Some might feel better in a few days, others might take a week or two. If your child isn't feeling better after two weeks, call your doctor.

Doctor follow-up: If your childâ€™s doctor asks for a follow-up appointment, make sure you go. It's important to check how your child is healing.

Healthy food and drinks: Give your child lots of fluids and healthy food. This helps the body heal.

Remember, you know your child best. If anything seems "off" or different about your child, don't hesitate to call the doctor. You're doing a great job looking after your child. Let's help them get better soon!

Sincerely,

The Medical Team
