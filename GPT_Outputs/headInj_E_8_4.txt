
Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Head Injury without Concussion

Dear Parents or Guardians,

Your child has suffered a minor head injury. Thankfully, our tests showed no signs of a concussion. However, it's still important to care for your child properly at home to ensure a quick recovery.

1. Rest and Monitor:
Make sure your child takes plenty of rest in the next few days. Also, keep a close eye on them, looking out for any unusual changes.

2. Pain Management:
Your child may have a headache or some discomfort. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) can help. Avoid aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), which can increase the risk of bleeding.

3. Bump Care:
If a bump has appeared, use a cold pack or ice wrapped in a cloth to reduce swelling. Apply it for 15 minutes every 2-3 hours as needed.

4. Diet:
Ensure your child drinks plenty of water and eats balanced meals. Good nutrition can help the healing process.

5. Avoid Risky Activities:
Until fully recovered, avoid activities that could lead to another head injury, like sports or playground activities.

6. Gradual Return to Activities:
Allow your child to return to normal activities like school and play slowly, making sure they feel comfortable and aren't feeling dizziness or headaches.

Seek Immediate Medical Attention If Your Child Experiences Any of the Following:

Severe or worsening headache
Vomiting more than once
Dizziness or loss of balance
Unusual sleepiness or difficulty waking up
Problems walking or talking
Changes in behavior or mood
Blood or clear fluid coming from the nose or ears
Problems with vision
Seizures (sudden shaking or convulsing)
Remember, it's okay to call your healthcare provider if you're worried or unsure about anything. It's better to be safe than sorry. Your child's well-being is our primary concern.

Thank you for trusting us with your child's care. They are strong, and with your loving support, they'll recover soon!

Sincerely,
