Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Bronchiolitis

Dear Parents,

Your child has been diagnosed with bronchiolitis, a common illness of the respiratory tract caused by a virus. Here are some important things to keep in mind and do as your child recovers at home.

Make sure your child gets lots of rest: Rest is very important for recovery. It helps the body fight the virus and get better faster.

Keep your child hydrated: Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids like water, juice, or an electrolyte solution for kids. This helps to loosen mucus and keep their throat moist.

Help with a runny nose: Use a soft tissue to gently clean your child's nose. A nasal bulb syringe can help remove mucus in babies. You can use saline (saltwater) nose drops to help loosen the mucus.

Monitor breathing: Keep an eye on your child’s breathing. Normal breathing for a child is usually between 20-30 breaths per minute when they're at rest. If you see your child breathing very fast, is wheezing, or their skin turns bluish, call your doctor right away.

Avoid smoke exposure: Keep your child away from cigarette smoke and other pollutants. These can make symptoms worse and delay recovery.

Control fever: If your child has a fever, you can use over-the-counter children’s fever reducers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen (but not for babies under 6 months). Follow the instructions on the package for the right dose. Remember to dress them in light clothing and not to overwrap them.

Medications: If the doctor prescribed any medication, make sure your child takes it as instructed. Don't use any cough and cold medicine unless the doctor said it's okay – they usually don't recommend them for young children.

Prevent spread: Teach your child to cough or sneeze into their elbow, not their hands. Make sure they wash their hands often to prevent spreading the virus to others.

Follow-up visit: Make sure to schedule a follow-up appointment with the doctor to ensure your child is recovering properly.

Remember, bronchiolitis often looks a lot like a common cold at first but it can get worse quickly, especially in babies. If at any time your child's symptoms seem to be getting worse or you are worried, don't hesitate to call your doctor or take your child to the emergency room.

Your child's health is a priority. Your careful attention can ensure a swift recovery.
