Patient Discharge Instructions: Pediatric Abdominal Pain

Dear Parents/Guardians,

Your child was recently seen for abdominal pain. Here's what you need to know and do next:

Pain Control: You may give your child over-the-counter pain medication, like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil), as needed. Follow the instructions on the bottle for the right dosage.

Food & Drink: Start with clear liquids like water, diluted juices, or broths. Once the pain is less, slowly introduce bland foods like rice, bananas, or toast. Avoid spicy or fatty foods.

Rest: Make sure your child gets plenty of rest. Rest helps the body heal.

Monitor Symptoms: Keep track of the pain. If it gets worse, becomes sharp, or if your child can't stop throwing up, or if there are changes in bowel movements (like blood or mucus), call your doctor right away.

Follow-Up Appointment: If the pain continues for more than 48 hours, even if it is not severe, make an appointment with your child’s doctor.

Hygiene: Remind your child to wash their hands regularly, especially before meals and after using the bathroom. This can prevent germs that cause stomach bugs.

Physical Activity: Allow light activity as tolerated. If pain increases with activity, your child should rest.

Remember, each child is unique and may react differently. Trust your instincts. You know your child best.

IMPORTANT

Take your child to the Emergency Department immediately if they:

Can’t stop vomiting
Have severe pain that won’t go away or gets worse
Have blood in their vomit or stool
Become very sleepy or hard to wake up
Have trouble breathing
We wish your child a speedy recovery. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

[Your Doctor's Name]
