Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Bronchiolitis

Dear Parents,

Your child has been diagnosed with bronchiolitis, a common illness that affects the small airways in the lungs. It usually occurs in children under two years of age.

Medications: Your child may not need medications, as bronchiolitis usually gets better on its own. If prescribed, ensure you give the correct dose at the right times. Never give over-the-counter cough or cold medicine to children under 4 unless directed by your doctor.

Hydration: Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids. This can be breast milk, formula, or water for older kids. If your child shows signs of dehydration like dry lips or fewer wet diapers, contact your doctor.

Rest: Rest can help your child recover. Try to make them as comfortable as possible.

Smoke-free environment: Keep your child away from tobacco smoke and other irritants, as they can worsen bronchiolitis symptoms.

Monitor symptoms: If your child has difficulty breathing, looks very tired, refuses to drink fluids, or has a bluish color around their mouth or fingernails, seek medical attention immediately.

Prevent spreading: Bronchiolitis is highly contagious. Wash your hands often, clean toys and surfaces regularly, and limit your child’s contact with sick people to prevent spreading the virus.

Follow-up: Schedule a follow-up appointment with your child’s doctor to ensure they're recovering well.

Remember, each child may experience symptoms differently. Trust your instincts and seek medical help if your child's condition doesn't improve or worsens.

Emergency Numbers

Always have your doctor's contact information and your local emergency number readily available.

Follow-up Appointment

Don't forget to make a follow-up appointment with your child's doctor within one week.

We hope your child feels better soon. Thank you for trusting us with their care.
