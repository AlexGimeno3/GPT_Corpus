
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR CHILD'S DIARRHEA AND VOMITING

Dear Parents,

We understand that it's distressing to see your child sick. But don't worry, diarrhea and vomiting are common in kids and usually get better on their own. Here's what you can do at home to help your child recover:

Fluids: The most crucial part of managing diarrhea and vomiting is to prevent dehydration. Offer small amounts of fluids frequently. For a baby, continue breastfeeding or formula. For an older child, try clear broths, diluted fruit juices, or rehydration solutions (like Pedialyte).

Nutrition: Once your child can keep down fluids, gradually reintroduce regular foods. Start with bland foods like rice, bananas, applesauce, and toast (the BRAT diet). Avoid foods high in sugar and fat until the stomach upset is gone.

Rest: Your child needs plenty of rest to recover. Keep them comfortable and ensure they're getting enough sleep.

Hand Hygiene: Make sure everyone in the household washes their hands often to prevent the spread of the illness.

Call the doctor if your child:

Is less than 6 months old or has a pre-existing health condition.
Is vomiting repeatedly and can't keep down fluids.
Has diarrhea for more than 24 hours.
Shows signs of dehydration: dry mouth, not urinating for 6 hours, crying without tears, or is extremely tired or cranky.
Has severe belly pain or a fever over 102°F (38.9°C).
Has blood in the vomit or stool.
Medications:

Do not give your child anti-diarrheal or anti-vomiting medicine unless told by the doctor. These can sometimes make things worse.

Remember, it’s normal to feel worried when your child is unwell. Just keep in mind that most cases of diarrhea and vomiting are not severe and improve within a couple of days. Your child's doctor is always available to help if you have questions or concerns. Don’t hesitate to reach out.

Wishing your child a speedy recovery,
