Dear Parents,

Your child is ready to go home! Let's talk about how you can help your child control their asthma.

Know the Triggers: Many things can make asthma worse. We call these "triggers." They can be smoke, dust, pets, or even cold weather. Help your child to avoid these things when possible.

Recognize the Signs: Asthma can make your child cough, feel short of breath, have a tight chest, or wheeze. If you see these signs, it's time to use their asthma medicine.

Use Medications Right: Your child may have two types of medicine: quick-relief (for when symptoms happen) and long-term control (used every day to prevent symptoms). Show your child the right way to use them and make sure they do it as we told you.

Keep the Inhaler Close: Always make sure your child has their quick-relief inhaler with them, especially when going out. It can help them breathe better if they have an asthma attack.

Create an Asthma Action Plan: We will give you a plan that says what medicine your child needs, when to give it, and what to do if they get worse. This will help you know when to call us or take them to the emergency room.

Regular Doctor Visits: Bring your child to see us for regular check-ups. This helps us make sure their asthma is under control.

Healthy Habits: Encourage your child to eat healthy foods, get plenty of sleep, and stay active. These things help keep their body strong and fight asthma.

Remember, asthma can be scary for your child. Encourage them to talk about their feelings. Let them know it's okay to ask for help if they are feeling unwell.

Please call us if you have any questions, or if your child's asthma seems to get worse. We're here to help!

You are doing a great job. Together, we can help your child breathe easier and feel better.

Take care,
