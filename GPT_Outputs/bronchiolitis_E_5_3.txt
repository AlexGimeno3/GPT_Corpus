
Pediatric Bronchiolitis Discharge Instructions

Dear Parent(s) or Caregiver(s),

We know it's worrying when your little one is not feeling well. Your child has been diagnosed with bronchiolitis, which is an infection in the lungs. Here's what you need to know to help them feel better at home.

What to Do:

Rest and Hydrate: Make sure your child gets lots of rest. They also need to drink plenty of fluids. This can be breast milk, formula, or water for older kids.

Medications: If your doctor prescribed any medicine, give it to your child as instructed. Some kids might need medicine to help open their airways.

Monitor Fever: If your child has a fever, you can give them a medicine like acetaminophen (Tylenol). Always use the correct dosage. If you're not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Comfort: Sometimes, sitting in a steamy bathroom can help with your child's breathing. You can also use a cool mist humidifier in your child's room.

Watch Out For:

Even at home, you need to watch your child closely. Call your doctor right away or go to the emergency room if your child:

Has trouble breathing or breathes very fast.
Cannot eat or drink and is not peeing as much as usual.
Looks very tired or is hard to wake up.
Has a blue color on the lips, face, or tongue.
Is very fussy and can't be comforted.
Follow-Up:

Remember to go to all follow-up appointments. Your child's doctor needs to check how they're doing. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call your doctor's office.

Prevention:

Bronchiolitis is often caused by viruses that are easy to catch. To prevent it from happening again:

Wash hands often, especially before meals.
Keep your child away from people who are sick.
Keep your child's toys and room clean.
If your child is old enough, teach them to cover their mouth when they cough or sneeze.
Taking care of a sick child can be tough. We're here to help. Remember, your child's doctor is your best resource for any questions or concerns. Take care and feel better soon!

Best,
