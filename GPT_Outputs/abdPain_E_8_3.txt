Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Abdominal Pain

Dear Parent(s) or Guardian(s),

Your child was diagnosed with abdominal pain. This pain can be due to a wide range of issues, and we have done our best to help manage it. Here are the next steps to follow at home:

Rest and Fluids: Make sure your child gets lots of rest and drinks plenty of fluids. Staying hydrated helps the body function better.

Medication: If we prescribed medicine, please follow the instructions carefully. Always give the correct dose at the right times. Don't stop the medicine early, even if your child feels better.

Diet: Start with bland, easy-to-digest foods like rice, bananas, and toast. Gradually return to normal meals. Avoid greasy, spicy, or hard-to-digest foods until the pain is fully gone.

Pain Tracking: Keep a log of your child's pain. Note the time, location, intensity (on a scale of 1-10), and anything else that seems related.

Warning Signs: If your child has any of the following, seek medical help right away:

Pain gets worse or moves to the lower right side
Fever over 100.4Â°F
Blood in the stool
Constant vomiting
Not peeing or much less than normal
Painful or difficult to pee
Unable to pass gas or poop
Can't walk or stand up straight due to the pain
The belly feels hard or swollen
Follow-up Appointment: It's crucial to follow up with your child's primary doctor within 1-2 weeks, or sooner if the pain continues or worsens.

Lifestyle Changes: Regular exercise and a balanced diet can help prevent some causes of abdominal pain. Aim for your child to get at least 60 minutes of exercise daily and incorporate a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into their diet.

Remember, abdominal pain can sometimes be serious. If you're worried about your child or their symptoms get worse, don't hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional.

Take good care of your child, and let us know if you need any further information or help.

Thank you,
