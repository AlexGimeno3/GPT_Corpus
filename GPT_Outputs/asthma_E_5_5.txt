
Dear Parents,

We want to make sure you have all the information you need to help manage your child's asthma. Here are some important instructions to follow at home.

Know the Asthma Action Plan: This plan tells you what medicines your child needs to take, how much, and when. It also includes steps to prevent asthma attacks and what to do during an attack. Make sure to follow this plan exactly.

Medications: Your child may have two types of medicines.

Controller medicine: This medicine helps to prevent asthma attacks. It's often taken every day, even when your child feels fine.
Rescue medicine: This medicine is taken when your child has an asthma attack. It helps to open up the airways quickly.
Identify Triggers: A trigger is something that can cause an asthma attack. Common triggers are dust, pets, smoke, and certain foods. Try to find out what triggers your child's asthma and avoid these as much as possible.

Watch for Symptoms: Signs that your child's asthma might be getting worse include coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, chest tightness, and feeling very tired. If these symptoms happen more often or get worse, contact your child's doctor right away.

Use an Inhaler Correctly: Make sure your child knows how to use their inhaler the right way. If your child is using a spacer (a tube attached to the inhaler), make sure they're using it properly. Your child's doctor or nurse can show you and your child how to do this.

Regular Doctor Visits: Even if your child is feeling fine, it's important to visit the doctor regularly. They will check if the asthma is under control and change the treatment if needed.

Healthy Lifestyle: Regular exercise is good for kids with asthma. Make sure your child also eats healthy foods and gets plenty of sleep. These can help keep your child's asthma in check.

Emergency Plan: Always have a plan for what to do in case of an emergency. If your child's symptoms get very bad, or their rescue medicine is not helping, get medical help right away.

Remember, every child's asthma is different, so what works for one child might not work for another. Keep a close eye on your child and keep in touch with their doctor to make sure they are getting the best care.

You're doing a great job as a parent. Together, we can keep your child's asthma under control.

Best,
