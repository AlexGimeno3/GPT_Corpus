
Dear Parent or Caregiver,

We treated your child today for a head injury. Fortunately, they did not have a concussion. Even so, it's still important to take some safety steps and watch your child carefully for the next few days. Here are some instructions:

Rest: Your child needs plenty of rest for the next 24-48 hours. Don't let them do sports, run, jump, or play rough games during this time.

Pain Management: You can use over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help with any pain. Please follow the dosage instructions on the box. Do not use aspirin because it can cause problems in children.

Ice Pack: You can put a cold pack on the area where your child hit their head. This can help reduce any swelling. Remember not to place the ice directly on the skin. Use a cloth or towel between the ice and your child's skin.

Fluids and Normal Diet: Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids and eats as they usually would.

Watch your child closely over the next 48 hours. If you see any of these symptoms, please call a doctor or bring your child back to the emergency room right away:

Changes in behavior or mood
Difficulty walking or talking
Trouble waking up or excessive sleepiness
Throwing up more than once
Severe headache or one that gets worse over time
Seizures or convulsions
Blood or fluid coming from the ears or nose
Vision problems like double vision or blurry vision
Weakness or numbness in any part of the body
Remember, while your child's head injury wasn't severe today, any worsening symptoms could mean there's a more serious problem.

It's common for children to feel a little upset or scared after a head injury. Try to help your child feel safe and loved. Give them a quiet, calm place to rest and reassure them that they're going to be okay.

Finally, please make a follow-up appointment with your child's primary care doctor within one week to ensure they are recovering well.

Your child's health is our top priority. We're always here to help if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
