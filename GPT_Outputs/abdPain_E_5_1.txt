Dear Parents,

Your child was in the hospital today for abdominal (stomach) pain. We've done everything to make sure your child feels better. Here are some instructions for you to follow at home:

Rest: Make sure your child gets plenty of rest. It helps the body to heal faster.

Diet: Start with bland and soft foods like bananas, rice, applesauce, toast, and yogurt. As your child feels better, slowly add more variety.

Hydration: Encourage your child to drink lots of water, clear broths, and fruit juices. This helps prevent dehydration.

Medications: Give your child any medicine that the doctor has prescribed. Never give your child more than the suggested dose.

Monitor Pain: Keep track of your child's pain. If it gets worse or if your child starts vomiting, has blood in their poop, or a fever, call the doctor right away.

Follow-Up Appointments: Remember to go to any follow-up appointments with the doctor. This helps us keep an eye on your child's health.

Regular Activity: Once your child is feeling better, they can go back to their normal activities. But remember, they should not push too hard. Start slow.

Remember, it's very important to listen to your child. If they say they are hurting or not feeling well, believe them and let us know. You know your child best.

We hope your child feels better soon! Don't hesitate to call the doctor or the hospital if you have questions or concerns.

Your child's health is important to us.

Best Wishes,
Your Child's Health Care Team
