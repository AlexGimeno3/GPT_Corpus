Discharge Instructions For Pediatric Fever

Hi Parents,

We know that it's scary when your kid has a fever, but no worries, it's the body's way of fighting off germs. Here are some things you can do at home:

1. Check Temperature
Use a thermometer to check your child's temperature. A fever is a temperature of 100.4째F (38째C) or higher.

2. Rest, Rest, Rest
Your child should get plenty of rest. This helps their body to fight off the illness causing the fever.

3. Stay Hydrated
Make sure your child drinks a lot of fluids. This can be water, fruit juice, or soup. This helps keep their body hydrated and can lower the fever.

4. Cool Down
You can help your child feel more comfortable by dressing them in light clothing. You can also place a cool, damp cloth on their forehead.

5. Medicines
Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can help lower fever. Be sure to follow the instructions on the package for your child's weight and age. If your child is less than 2 years old, ask the doctor before giving any medicine.

6. When to Call the Doctor
Call your doctor if:

Your child's fever lasts more than 3 days.
The fever is over 104째F (40째C).
Your child is very sleepy or cranky, or you can't wake them up.
Your child has trouble breathing.
Your child has a rash, stiff neck, severe headache, ear pain, or is not peeing as much as usual.
7. Follow-Up
Come back to the doctor if the fever comes back after it goes away, or if your child gets a new fever within a few weeks.

Remember, a fever is the body's way of fighting off illness. Your child's body is doing its job. With your help at home, your child will feel better soon.

Note: This is general advice and may not fit every child or fever. Always ask your doctor if you have any questions or worries.
