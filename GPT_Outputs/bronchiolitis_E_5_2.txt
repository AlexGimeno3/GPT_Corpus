Dear Parents,

Your child has been diagnosed with bronchiolitis, an illness that makes it hard for them to breathe. The virus that causes this condition has affected the tiny air tubes in their lungs, making them swell and filled with mucus. Here's what you need to do to help your child get better:

Make sure they rest and hydrate. Just like with any illness, resting helps the body to heal. Make sure your child gets lots of sleep and drinks plenty of fluids to keep hydrated.

Avoid spreading the virus. Bronchiolitis is contagious, which means it can spread to others. It's important for everyone in your house to wash their hands often. Also, keep your child away from other kids, especially those who are very young, until your child is no longer sick.

Relieve a stuffy nose. If your child's nose is stuffy, you can use a bulb syringe to remove mucus. You may use saline (salt water) nose drops to make this easier.

Monitor for trouble breathing. Watch for signs that your child is having more trouble breathing. These might include:

Their nostrils getting bigger when they breathe
They are breathing faster than usual
The skin around their ribs and neck pulls in when they breathe
Their lips or face turn blue
They are very tired or hard to wake up
No smoking. Please don't smoke, especially inside your home. Secondhand smoke can make your child's symptoms worse.

Medicines. If the doctor prescribed any medicines, be sure to give them as directed. Don't give your child cough or cold medicines unless the doctor tells you to, as these can be dangerous in young kids.

Follow-up care. Make a follow-up appointment with your child's doctor or as directed by our hospital staff. This allows the doctor to check if your child is recovering well.

Remember, if your child seems to be getting worse or you're worried about them, don't hesitate to call your doctor or bring them back to the hospital. We're here to help!

Wishing your child a quick recovery.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]
