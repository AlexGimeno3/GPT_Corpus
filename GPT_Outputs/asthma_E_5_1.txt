Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Asthma

Hello,

Your child has been diagnosed with asthma. Asthma is a condition where the airways in the lungs become narrow and inflamed. This can cause trouble breathing, coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness. But don't worry, with the right care, your child can have a normal and active life.

Taking Medicine

Your child's doctor has prescribed medicine to help control the asthma. Some medicines are for everyday use to prevent symptoms, and others are for use when symptoms get worse. Make sure your child takes their medicine exactly as the doctor told you.

Using Inhalers

Your child may have been given an inhaler, a small device that delivers medicine directly to the lungs. The doctor or nurse showed you how to use it. Make sure your child uses it the right way. If you're unsure, don't hesitate to ask the doctor or nurse again.

Avoid Triggers

Different things can make asthma worse, like dust, pets, smoke, and cold air. These are called triggers. Find out what triggers your child's asthma and try to keep them away from these things as much as possible.

Asthma Action Plan

Your child's doctor will provide an "asthma action plan". This plan will tell you what medicine your child should take, what triggers to avoid, and what to do if your child has an asthma attack. Make sure you understand this plan and ask the doctor any questions if something is not clear.

When to Seek Help

If your child's symptoms get worse, they might be having an asthma attack. Signs of this can include:

Trouble speaking or eating because it's hard to breathe.
Using belly muscles to breathe or nostrils flaring.
The quick-relief medicine doesn't help, or they need it more often than every 4 hours.
If these happen, follow the asthma action plan. If your child is still having trouble, call the doctor or go to the emergency room right away.

Follow-Up Appointment

It's important to have regular check-ups with the doctor. The doctor will make sure the medicines are working and adjust them if needed. Make sure you keep these appointments.

Remember, it's important to take asthma seriously. With the right care and management, your child can live a normal, healthy life. If you have any questions or need help, reach out to your child's doctor. They are there to support you and your child.

Stay strong and keep taking good care of your child!
