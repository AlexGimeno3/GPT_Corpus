1. Overview:
Your child has suffered a head injury, but we have examined them carefully, and they do not have a concussion. This is good news, but it's still important to take care of them at home and watch for any changes.

2. Home Care Instructions:

Rest and Recovery: Your child should rest for the next 24-48 hours. They can return to their regular activities after that if they feel okay.

Pain Management: If your child has pain, you can give them over-the-counter medication, like acetaminophen (Tylenol). Do not give them aspirin or ibuprofen unless your doctor tells you it's okay.

Applying Ice: Use an ice pack on the area of the injury for 15-20 minutes at a time every 2-3 hours for the first day. This helps to reduce swelling and pain. Wrap the ice pack in a towel to protect your child's skin.

3. Symptoms to Watch Out For:
Call your child's doctor or go back to the hospital if your child:

Has a headache that gets worse or does not go away.
Throws up more than once.
Seems very tired or sleepy.
Has trouble walking or speaking.
Seems confused or acts different than usual.
Has trouble seeing or hearing.
Has clear or bloody fluid coming from their nose or ears.
4. Follow-Up Care:
Make a follow-up appointment with your child's pediatrician within 1 week or as advised. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to the doctor's office.

5. Safety Precautions for the Future:
To prevent future injuries, make sure your child always wears a helmet while biking, skating, or doing any other risky activity. Ensure your home is child-safe by removing tripping hazards, and secure furniture and TVs to the wall to prevent them from falling over.

Remember, it's normal for your child to feel a little sleepy or nauseous after a head injury. However, if these symptoms get worse or don't go away, get medical help right away. Keep these instructions handy and follow them closely to help your child recover fully.
