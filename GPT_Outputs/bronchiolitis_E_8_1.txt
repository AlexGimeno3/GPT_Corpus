Patient Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Bronchiolitis

Dear Parents,

Your child has been diagnosed with bronchiolitis, a common illness in children that affects the small airways in the lungs. This document provides important information about how to take care of your child after leaving the hospital.

1. Medication

Your doctor may have prescribed certain medications for your child. Please make sure you understand how and when to give these. Do not give your child any other medicine without talking to the doctor first.

2. Fluids

Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids like water or juice. This helps to loosen mucus and keep them hydrated. If your child is less than 6 months old, continue with breastmilk or formula.

3. Rest

Encourage your child to rest. This helps their body recover faster. Try to keep their environment calm and quiet.

4. Monitor Breathing

Keep an eye on your child's breathing. If it becomes too fast or they are struggling to breathe, this is serious. Look for signs such as flaring nostrils, sucking in around the neck and ribs, or bluish lips or face. If you see any of these, call 911 or take your child to the emergency room right away.

5. Avoid Smoke Exposure

Keep your child away from cigarette smoke. Smoke can make bronchiolitis worse.

6. Handwashing

Wash your hands and your child's hands regularly. This can help stop the spread of the virus that caused the bronchiolitis.

Follow-Up Visit

It's very important to go to all follow-up appointments with your child's doctor. If your childâ€™s symptoms do not improve in a few days, or get worse, call the doctor right away.

Remember, every child is different. Your child may recover from bronchiolitis in a few days, or it may take a few weeks. Be patient and follow these instructions closely.

Thank you for trusting us with the care of your child. We wish your child a quick recovery.
