Dear Parent or Guardian,

Your child has been seen today for abdominal pain. They may not feel 100% right away, but there are things you can do to help them get better.

Rest and Comfort: It's crucial to make sure your child gets plenty of rest. This helps their body to heal. A hot water bottle or heating pad set on low can also ease the tummy ache.

Eating and Drinking: Small, light meals are best for a few days. Try foods like rice, applesauce, toast, or bananas (we call this the BRAT diet). It's very important your child stays hydrated. Water, clear broths, or drinks like Pedialyte can help.

Medicine: If we've given any medicine, use it as directed. Do not use any other medicines without asking us first, even those sold over the counter.

Follow-Up Appointments: We might want to see your child again in a few days to see how they are doing. Make sure you don't miss these visits.

Warning Signs: It's important to keep an eye on your child for a while. If they get a high fever (above 100.4°F or 38°C), their pain gets worse, or they start vomiting a lot, you should call us right away or take them to the emergency room.

Emotional Support: Tummy aches can be scary for children. Remind them it's okay to feel upset or afraid and that you're there to help them feel better.

Please don't hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns. It's important we work together to help your child get better.
