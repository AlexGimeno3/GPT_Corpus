Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Diarrhea and Vomiting

Dear Parent or Guardian,

Your child was treated today for vomiting and diarrhea. Here is what you need to do to help them get better:

Rest and Fluids: Make sure your child gets plenty of rest. Also, it's important to replace the water and salts they've lost. You can use special drinks called oral rehydration solutions like Pedialyte. Avoid sugary drinks like juice or soda, they can make diarrhea worse.

Food: Once your child feels ready to eat, start with bland, easy-to-digest foods like toast, rice, bananas, and applesauce. As they start feeling better, they can begin to eat their regular diet.

Medicine: If your doctor has prescribed medicine, give it exactly as told. Never use over-the-counter diarrhea or vomiting medicine unless your doctor says it's okay.

Hygiene: Teach your child to wash their hands after going to the bathroom and before eating. This helps keep germs from spreading.

Monitoring: Keep an eye on your child's pee. It should be light yellow. If it's dark yellow or if they're peeing less than usual, they might be getting dehydrated. Also, watch for fever, severe belly pain, bloody or black poop, or if they seem very tired or fussy.

When to get help:

Call your doctor or go back to the hospital if:

Your child can't keep down fluids or their diarrhea doesn't get better after 24 hours.
Your child's pee is dark yellow or they are peeing less than usual.
Your child has a high fever or severe belly pain.
You see blood or black color in your child's poop.
Your child is very tired, not waking up, or seems too sick.
Remember, you're doing a great job taking care of your child. If you have any worries, call your doctor or nurse. They are there to help you!

Sincerely,
