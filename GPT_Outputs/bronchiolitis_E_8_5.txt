Dear Parents,

Your child has been diagnosed with a lung condition known as bronchiolitis. It’s a common illness in children, especially under 2 years old. Here are some guidelines to help care for your child at home.

1. Rest and Fluids: Make sure your child gets plenty of rest. This will help their body fight off the virus. Keep them well-hydrated with fluids like water, breastmilk, or formula. This can also thin out mucus, making it easier for them to breathe.

2. Breathing: Your child might have difficulty breathing due to mucus in their lungs. Sitting your child upright can help make breathing easier.

3. Humidity: Use a cool-mist humidifier in your child's room. This can help loosen the mucus in their lungs and make it easier for them to breathe. Remember to clean the humidifier regularly.

4. Feeding: Your child might not feel like eating. That's okay. Try smaller, more frequent meals. If your child is breastfeeding or bottle-feeding, feed them in an upright position.

5. Nose Care: Use a rubber bulb syringe to gently remove mucus from your child's nose. This can make eating and breathing easier.

6. Medicines: Don’t give your child over-the-counter cough and cold medicines unless your doctor says it's okay. These can be harmful to young children. If your child has a fever, ask your doctor about using a medicine like acetaminophen.

7. Follow-up: Keep up with your child's regular doctor appointments. Follow-up is important to ensure your child is recovering well.

When to seek immediate medical help:
If your child shows signs like:

Breathing very fast or having trouble breathing
Lips or skin turning blue
Not drinking fluids or showing signs of dehydration like dry lips, crying without tears, or less urination
High fever or a fever that doesn’t go away
Trouble waking up or not interacting as usual
A cough that gets much worse or they start choking
In these cases, call your doctor right away or go to the nearest emergency room.

Remember, you know your child best. If something doesn’t seem right, it's better to seek medical help.

It may take a little while, but with good home care, your child should recover from bronchiolitis in about 2 weeks.

Take care and get well soon!
