
Dear Parents/Guardians,

Your child has been treated for asthma. We know this might be scary for both of you, but don't worry. We're here to help. Here are some easy steps you can follow at home to help your child feel better:

Medicines: Give your child the medicines we've prescribed. They might include a controller inhaler (to prevent asthma attacks), and a rescue inhaler (for sudden breathing problems). Always use them as instructed.

Avoid Triggers: Some things can make your child's asthma worse. These are called 'triggers'. Common ones include smoke, dust, mold, pets, cold air, and exercise. Help your child stay away from their triggers as much as possible.

Asthma Action Plan: We have given you an asthma action plan. This is like a map that shows what to do if your child's asthma gets worse. It's color-coded like a traffic light: green means everything's okay, yellow is a warning, and red is an emergency. Make sure you know what to do in each zone.

Regular Check-ups: It's important to bring your child back to the doctor's office for regular check-ups. This helps us see how they're doing and if we need to adjust their medicines.

Healthy Lifestyle: A healthy lifestyle can also help control asthma. Encourage your child to eat healthy foods, get regular exercise (if it's not a trigger), and sleep well.

If your child's asthma symptoms get worse or they need to use their rescue inhaler more often, that's a sign you should call us or come to the hospital right away. Also, if your child is in the 'red zone' of their asthma action plan, that's an emergency.

Remember, every child is unique, and asthma affects everyone differently. This may take a little time to get used to, but we are always here for you. Your child can live a normal and active life with the right plan and care.

Stay strong!

Your child's healthcare team
