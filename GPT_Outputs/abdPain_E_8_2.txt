
Pediatric Abdominal Pain Discharge Instructions

1. Medications
If we prescribed medicine, make sure to give your child the correct dosage at the right times. Never exceed the advised amount. If we gave you a prescription for pain relief, only use it as directed. Remember, over-the-counter medicine like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with mild pain but must be used as per the package instructions.

2. Diet
A healthy diet is important to help your child feel better. Start with easily digestible foods like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (the BRAT diet). You can add more variety as your child feels better. Avoid foods that are hard to digest, like fatty, fried, or spicy foods. Ensure your child drinks plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.

3. Rest
Rest is vital when your child isn't feeling well. Make sure they get enough sleep and take it easy until they feel better.

4. Observation
Keep a close eye on your child. If the pain doesn't get better in 24-48 hours, becomes more intense, or if new symptoms show up, like vomiting, fever, or if your child cannot pass stool or gas, you should call us or take your child to the emergency room right away.

5. Follow-up
Make a follow-up appointment with your child's doctor within one week or sooner if the pain doesn't improve or gets worse. This helps ensure your child is recovering as they should be.

Remember:

No strenuous physical activity until your child feels better.
Encourage your child to express their feelings about the pain. It might help understand what's causing it.
Teach your child to wash their hands often. This can prevent stomach bugs, a common cause of abdominal pain.
This advice is meant to help manage your child’s abdominal pain, but it's very important to keep us informed about your child’s condition. If you have any concerns or if the symptoms get worse, please contact us or visit the emergency department.
