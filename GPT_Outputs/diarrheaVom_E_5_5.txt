
Diarrhea and Vomiting: Instructions After Your Child's Visit

Dear Parents,

Your child has been treated for diarrhea and vomiting. These symptoms often come from a stomach bug. The good news is that most children get better in a few days. Here's how you can help your child at home:

Fluids are Important: Make sure your child drinks plenty of liquids to avoid dehydration. Water, broth, and diluted fruit juices are good. There are also special drinks called 'oral rehydration solutions' like Pedialyte, which are very helpful. Try to avoid drinks high in sugar like soda.

Food Matters: Start with bland foods like crackers, toast, rice, bananas, or applesauce when your child starts eating again. These are gentle on the stomach. Slowly add in more variety of foods as your child feels better.

Rest and Comfort: Your child might be tired and need extra sleep. Make sure they rest well and keep them comfortable.

Hygiene is Key: Wash your hands and your child's hands regularly. This can stop the bug from spreading to others in the house.

Medication: If the doctor gave your child any medication, be sure to give it exactly as directed. Don't give your child any other medicines for vomiting or diarrhea unless the doctor says it's okay.

Remember:

If your child seems very sick, can't drink fluids, has blood in their poop or vomit, or has a high fever, call the doctor or bring your child back to the hospital right away.

Also, if your child's symptoms last more than a few days or they can't pee, get very sleepy, or have a dry mouth or tongue, it's time to call the doctor.

Diarrhea and vomiting are usually not serious, but it's always important to watch your child closely.

Please follow these steps, and your child should be feeling better soon!
