What is Asthma?
Asthma is a lung disease that can make it hard to breathe. It can cause the airways to swell and produce extra mucus, which can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.

Medications
Your child's doctor has prescribed some medicines to control your child's asthma. These might include:

Quick-relief inhalers (bronchodilators): Use this when your child has asthma symptoms or an attack. They quickly open the airways.
Long-term control medicines: These are taken every day, even when your child feels fine, to prevent symptoms.
Make sure to use these medicines exactly as your doctor has instructed. Don't stop the medicines or change the dose without talking to your doctor.

Preventing Asthma Attacks
There are many things you can do to help prevent asthma attacks:

Avoid triggers: Triggers are things that can start an asthma attack. Common triggers are dust, smoke, pet dander, pollen, and cold air. Learn what triggers your child's asthma and try to keep them away from it.
Follow an Asthma Action Plan: This plan, made with your doctor, lists daily treatments, such as which medicines to take and when, and what to do during an asthma attack.
Regular Check-ups: Keep all appointments with your child's doctor to monitor the asthma.
Recognizing an Asthma Attack
Asthma attacks can range from mild to severe. They might include:

Coughing
Wheezing
Chest tightness
Shortness of breath
If your child's symptoms are getting worse or not improving with their quick-relief medicine, seek medical help immediately.

Follow-up
Make sure to schedule and attend all follow-up appointments with your child's doctor. These visits help keep your child's asthma under control.

Emergency!
Call 911 or get to the nearest emergency room if your child:

Has severe difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Can't speak or walk because they are struggling to breathe
Has blue lips or face
Remember, asthma can be scary for both you and your child. You're not alone, and there are many resources available to help you understand and manage your child's asthma.

The above is a general guideline. Always follow the specific instructions given by your child's doctor or other healthcare provider.
