
Dear Parent or Guardian,

Your child was seen today for a fever. Here's a simple guide on how to take care of them at home.

Medication: If the doctor prescribed any medication, make sure your child takes it as told. Over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can help with fever and discomfort. Do not give aspirin to your child. Always follow the label for the correct dosage based on your child's weight and age.

Rest and Fluids: Ensure your child gets plenty of rest to help their body fight off the infection. It's also important to keep your child hydrated. Give them water, fruit juice, or broth to drink often.

Check Temperatures: Keep checking your child's temperature with a thermometer. If it goes above 102°F (38.9°C) or doesn't get better after a couple of days, call the doctor.

Comfort Measures: Dress your child in light clothing. If they're chilly, a light blanket is enough. A lukewarm bath or washcloth can also help to bring down a fever.

Monitor Other Symptoms: If your child gets new symptoms like a rash, breathing problems, seems very sleepy, or can't keep fluids down, call the doctor right away.

Avoid Spreading Germs: Teach your child to cover their mouth and nose when they cough or sneeze, and to wash their hands often to prevent spreading germs.

Remember, fever is a sign that your child's body is fighting an infection. But, if you're worried about how your child is feeling, you can always call the doctor or nurse. They are there to help you.

Thank you for taking good care of your child.

Best wishes,
