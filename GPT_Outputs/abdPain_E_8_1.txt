Pediatric Abdominal Pain Discharge Instructions

Dear Parents or Guardians,

Pain Management: Over-the-counter medicine like Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can be used to manage your child's pain. Follow the instructions on the package for how much to give based on your child's weight and age. Avoid aspirin because it could cause Reye’s syndrome, a rare but serious condition in children.

Diet: Start with easy-to-digest foods like applesauce, rice, bananas, and toast (often known as the BRAT diet). Gradually add in regular foods as your child's stomach allows.

Hydration: Encourage your child to drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated, especially if they've been vomiting. Water, diluted fruit juices, or rehydration drinks like Pedialyte can help.

Rest: Allow your child plenty of rest. This helps the body heal faster.

When to Seek Further Help: Call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room if your child:

Has severe pain or the pain gets worse over time
Vomits repeatedly and cannot keep down fluids
Has bloody or black stools
Has a high fever (over 100.4°F or 38°C)
Has signs of dehydration like dry mouth, crying without tears, or urinating less often
Is not improving after 48 hours or gets worse
Follow-up Care: Keep all follow-up appointments with your child's pediatrician. If tests were done, it's important to discuss the results and next steps.

Remember, every child's health situation is different. Always follow your doctor's specific instructions for your child. The above guidelines are just that - guidelines. They may not apply to every situation.

If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to contact your child's doctor. They're there to help you and your child.

Best regards,
Your Pediatric Care Team
