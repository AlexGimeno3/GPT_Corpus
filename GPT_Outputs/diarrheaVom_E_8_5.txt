Title: Discharge Instructions for Child’s Diarrhea and Vomiting

Dear Parent(s),

Your child has been treated for diarrhea and vomiting, likely caused by a viral infection. Here are some important instructions to help your child get better.

Hydration: This is critical. Rehydration drinks like Pedialyte can help replace lost fluids and minerals. Avoid giving soda or fruit juices. If your child refuses to take the rehydration drinks, give them small sips of water frequently.

Diet: Start with clear fluids. Once vomiting is under control, gradually reintroduce bland foods like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (also known as the BRAT diet). Slowly add in other foods as tolerated.

Rest: Your child should rest at home until 24 hours after vomiting and diarrhea have stopped. Rest helps the body recover.

Handwashing: Teach your child to wash their hands regularly. It helps stop the spread of germs.

Medication: Do not give anti-diarrhea medicine unless prescribed by your doctor. If a prescription was given, make sure to follow the dosage instructions exactly.

Watch for these symptoms, which may indicate a need for immediate medical attention:

Dehydration: Signs include crying without tears, a dry mouth, urinating less than usual, or sunken eyes.
High fever: Temperature over 102°F (38.9°C).
Severe stomach pain.
Blood in the stool or vomit.
Diarrhea or vomiting that lasts more than 24 hours.
Lack of energy or unresponsiveness.
If you notice these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider right away or visit the nearest emergency room. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call your pediatrician.

Remember, caring for a sick child can be challenging. You're doing a great job!

Best wishes for your child's quick recovery.

Sincerely,
