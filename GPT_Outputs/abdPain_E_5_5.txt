Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Abdominal Pain

Hello Parents,

Your child has been seen for belly pain. Here are instructions on what you can do to help them feel better:

Rest and Care at Home:

Ease on Eating: Let your child's stomach rest for a few hours. Then, give them small amounts of light foods like applesauce, rice, or toast. Avoid spicy, greasy or hard-to-digest foods.

Stay Hydrated: Make sure your child drinks lots of fluids like water or an electrolyte solution to avoid getting dehydrated. Avoid fizzy drinks, caffeine, or drinks with a lot of sugar.

Relax and Rest: Your child should get plenty of rest and avoid intense play or heavy lifting.

Medicines:

Follow Doctor's Orders: If a medicine was prescribed, follow the instructions given by your doctor.

Pain Relief: Over-the-counter medicine like acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be given for pain. Remember, no aspirin for kids under 18.

Monitor Your Child:

Look for Changes: Keep an eye on your child's pain. If it gets worse, or if your child starts having a fever, throwing up, or has blood in their poop, call your doctor right away.

Regular Check-Ins: Regularly ask your child how they're feeling. The pain should get less and less over time. If it doesn't, contact your doctor.

Follow-Up:

Make sure you schedule a follow-up appointment with your child's doctor to make sure everything is getting better.

Remember, this is a general guide. Always follow your doctor's advice first. Reach out to your healthcare team if you have any questions or if anything changes. Your child's health and comfort are our top priority.

With your good care at home, your child should be feeling better soon!

Thanks,
