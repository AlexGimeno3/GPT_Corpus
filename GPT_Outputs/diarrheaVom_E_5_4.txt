
Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Diarrhea and Vomiting

Dear Parents,

Your child has had vomiting and diarrhea, but it's time to go home from the hospital now. Here's what you need to know to take care of them.

1. Food and Drink:
Give your child plenty of fluids to drink. Water, broths, and special drinks like Pedialyte are good. This helps to replace the fluids lost from throwing up or having loose stools. Avoid juices and soda.

Start with small sips every 15-30 minutes. If your child keeps it down, give a bit more next time. As your child feels better, slowly add bland foods like toast, rice, bananas, and applesauce. Avoid fatty or spicy foods for now.

2. Rest:
Make sure your child gets lots of rest. This helps their body heal.

3. Wash Hands:
Everyone in the house should wash their hands well and often. This can help stop the sickness from spreading to others.

4. Medicine:
Give medicine as the doctor said. Don't give your child any medicine for vomiting or diarrhea unless the doctor said to. If your child has a fever, it's okay to give them Tylenol or Motrin, as long as the doctor said it's okay.

5. Follow-up:
Make a follow-up appointment with your child's doctor in a week or as advised.

When to Get Help:
Call the doctor or go back to the hospital if:

Your child can't keep down fluids.
They have a high fever that doesn't go down with medicine.
They're very sleepy or hard to wake up.
They're peeing less or not at all.
They have blood in their vomit or poop.
Their belly hurts a lot.
They're not getting better in 24-48 hours.
Remember, you're doing a great job! Taking care of a sick child can be tough, but with rest, the right food and drink, and a little time, your child should feel better soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
