Patient Discharge Instructions: Pediatric Abdominal Pain

Dear Parents,

Your child was treated today for abdominal (stomach) pain. Please carefully read and follow these instructions to help them recover.

Medications:
The doctor may have given your child a prescription or recommended an over-the-counter medication. Give it as instructed and finish the entire course, even if your child feels better. Never give your child medication that was not prescribed for them.

Diet:
Start with bland, easy-to-digest foods like rice, bananas, or toast. Gradually return to a normal diet as your child's stomach gets better.

Hydration:
Encourage your child to drink plenty of fluids, especially if they had vomiting or diarrhea. Water, soup, and electrolyte drinks can help prevent dehydration.

Rest:
Your child needs plenty of rest to recover. Make sure they get a good night's sleep and take naps as needed.

Pain Management:
If your child continues to have pain, you can use over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol). Follow the instructions on the package.

Monitoring:
Watch out for changes in your child's pain. If the pain gets worse or if your child starts to have other symptoms, like fever, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in their stool or urine, or if they are unable to eat or drink, call your doctor immediately or take your child to the nearest emergency room.

Follow-Up Care:
Please make sure to attend all follow-up appointments with your child's doctor. This helps them monitor your child's health and ensure they are recovering as expected.

Remember, every child is unique. Their recovery may not look like someone else's. Be patient and supportive. With proper care, your child should start feeling better soon.

Emergency:
If your child has difficulty breathing, has intense pain, becomes overly sleepy, faints, or if you can't wake them up, these are emergencies. Call 911 immediately.

Contact Information:
If you have any questions or if your child's condition worsens, don't hesitate to call our office. It's always better to ask if you're not sure.

Thank you for trusting us with your child's care.

Sincerely,
