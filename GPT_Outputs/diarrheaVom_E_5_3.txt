Pediatric Diarrhea and Vomiting Discharge Instructions

Dear Parents,

Your child was seen today for diarrhea and vomiting. Here are some things you need to do at home to help your child get better.

1. Rest and Fluids:

Your child may be feeling very tired because of the sickness. It's good to let them rest as much as they want. When they're awake, make sure they drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. This is very important because diarrhea and vomiting make your child lose fluids. You can give them water, broth, or an oral rehydration solution like Pedialyte.

2. Food:

When your child feels ready to eat, start with bland foods like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (we call this the BRAT diet). Avoid foods that are too fatty, spicy, or have a lot of dairy until they feel better.

3. Medicine:

If the doctor gave a medicine, give it as instructed. Never give your child medicine for adults or anything not approved by your doctor.

4. Watch for Warning Signs:

Your child should start to feel better in a few days. But if they get worse, or if they show these signs, call the doctor right away:

Can't keep down fluids
Doesn't pee or their pee is very dark
Acts very tired or hard to wake up
Has a fever over 102°F
Has blood in their poop or vomit
Doesn’t get better after a few days
5. Hand Washing:

Make sure everyone in your house washes their hands often. This helps stop the sickness from spreading to others.

6. Follow-Up:

Schedule a follow-up appointment with your doctor. This lets them make sure your child is getting better.

Remember, you know your child best. If anything worries you, don't hesitate to call the doctor.

Take care,
Your Care Team
