
Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Diarrhea and Vomiting

When You're at Home

Hydrate: Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Use oral rehydration solutions (ORS) like Pedialyte. Start with small sips and gradually increase if tolerated.

Eat Right: When your child feels ready, reintroduce bland foods. Start with things like rice, crackers, or bananas. Avoid spicy or greasy foods until your child is completely better.

Rest: Your child needs to rest as much as possible. This helps their body recover.

Medications

Do not give your child over-the-counter diarrhea medications unless your doctor has said it's okay. They can be harmful to kids.

Warning Signs

Bring your child back to the doctor if:

They can't keep fluids down or continue to vomit
Their diarrhea doesn't get better after 2 days
They seem very tired or won't wake up
They are urinating less than usual
They have a high fever
They have severe stomach pain
Their mouth and throat feel dry, or their eyes look sunken
These can be signs of severe dehydration or other serious issues.

Prevention

To prevent diarrhea and vomiting in the future, teach your child good hygiene habits:

Wash hands frequently, especially after using the toilet and before meals
Teach them not to share food, drinks, or utensils with others
Make sure your child is up-to-date with their vaccinations
