
Dear Parent or Guardian,

Your child has been diagnosed with diarrhea and vomiting. Here are instructions to help them feel better at home.

Rest: Lots of sleep and rest will help your child's body to fight off sickness.

Fluids: Keep your child hydrated. Diarrhea and vomiting cause a loss of fluids and nutrients from the body. Give them water, broth, or oral rehydration solutions like Pedialyte. Avoid juice or soda, these may make diarrhea worse.

Food: Once vomiting stops, start with bland, easy-to-digest foods. Think of the BRAT diet: Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast. Add in more food types slowly when diarrhea lessens.

Hand Washing: Clean hands can stop the spread of illness. Make sure everyone in the house washes their hands often, especially after using the bathroom and before eating.

Medicines: Over-the-counter medicines can be risky for kids. Always talk to a doctor before giving your child new medicine.

Follow-up Appointment: Make an appointment with your child's doctor in 1 week, or sooner if the symptoms don't improve in 48 hours or if your child becomes worse.

Watch for these signs. If they happen, call the doctor or take your child to the Emergency Room:

Very sleepy or hard to wake up.
Not peeing at least once every 8 hours.
Has a fever above 102Â°F.
Keeps vomiting for more than 24 hours.
Has blood in the vomit or stool.
Severe belly pain.
Severe headache or stiff neck.
Trouble breathing.
Remember, you know your child best. If you feel like something is really wrong, don't hesitate to get medical help.

Thank you for trusting us with your child's care. With these steps, we hope they will get better soon.

Best,

[Doctor's Name]
