
Dear Parent/Guardian,

Your child has had a minor head injury. We're glad to tell you that there are no signs of a concussion, but we do need you to monitor them at home for any changes.

Rest and Activity

Ensure your child gets plenty of rest in the first 24-48 hours. This helps the healing process.
Avoid vigorous physical activities, like running or playing sports, until they feel completely well again.
Slowly reintroduce normal activities. If anything makes symptoms worse, stop that activity and give them more time to rest.
Pain Management

Minor head injuries may cause a headache. You can use over-the-counter medicine like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) to manage pain. Follow the directions on the box.
Avoid giving aspirin to children under 16 years old unless instructed by a doctor.
Monitoring Symptoms
Over the next 24-48 hours, watch out for any changes in your child's behavior or health. Please seek immediate medical help if you notice any of these signs:

Severe headache or a headache that worsens over time.
Repeated vomiting.
Unusual sleepiness or trouble waking up.
Seizures (sudden jerking movements or loss of consciousness).
Difficulty recognizing familiar people or places.
Slurred speech or confusion.
Loss of balance or problems walking.
Blurry or double vision.
Changes in mood like increased irritability or sudden sadness.
Fluid (clear or bloody) draining from the ears or nose.
Follow-up Care
Make sure to schedule a follow-up visit with your child's regular doctor within 1-2 weeks to check how they're doing.

Remember: You know your child best. If you are worried about any changes in their behavior, mood, or physical state, it's always best to seek medical advice.

Thank you for being a great caregiver to your child during this time. Your love and support will help them recover quickly.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call us or your pediatrician.

Best,
