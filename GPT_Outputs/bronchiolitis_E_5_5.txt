Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Bronchiolitis

Dear Parents,

Your child has been diagnosed with bronchiolitis, a lung illness that happens mostly in young children. It often looks like a common cold at first but can get a bit worse. These instructions are to help you take care of your child at home:

1. Medicines: If the doctor gave a prescription, go to the pharmacy and get it. Follow the instructions on the bottle. Don't give your child over-the-counter cough and cold medicines unless your doctor says it's okay. They're not safe for kids under 4 years old.

2. Drinking and Eating: Make sure your child drinks lots of fluids. This could be water, juice, or breastmilk or formula if they're a baby. This helps keep their body strong and stops them from getting dehydrated. If your child is vomiting, try smaller amounts of fluid more often.

3. Rest: Your child will need lots of sleep. Try to make them as comfortable as possible. This can be hard when they're coughing a lot, so prop up their head a bit to help.

4. Fever: If your child has a fever, you can give them acetaminophen (like Tylenol) or ibuprofen (like Advil) to help. But remember, no aspirin for children under 18.

5. Smoking: Don't smoke in the house or around your child. Second-hand smoke can make bronchiolitis worse.

6. Washing Hands: Wash your hands and your child's hands often. This helps stop the germs from spreading to other people.

When to call the doctor

Even after leaving the hospital, it's important to keep an eye on your child. Call the doctor if:

Your child seems very tired or is hard to wake up.
They're not drinking enough or are having fewer wet diapers.
They're breathing very fast or it looks hard for them to breathe.
Their lips or skin are looking blue.
The coughing gets much worse or they start wheezing (a high-pitched noise when breathing out).
If you can't reach your doctor, go to the emergency room.

Preventing bronchiolitis

You can't always prevent bronchiolitis, but washing hands often and staying away from sick people can help. If your child is younger than 2 and at high risk, a medicine called palivizumab can help. Ask your doctor about it.

Remember, you're doing a great job! Taking care of a sick child can be tough. If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask your doctor.

Take care,
