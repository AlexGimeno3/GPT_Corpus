Title: Taking Care of Your Child After Abdominal Pain

Dear Parents,

Your child has been looked at by a doctor because they had tummy (abdominal) pain. We have given them the right care they need, and now they can go home. Here are some things you can do to help your child feel better.

Comfort and Care:

Rest: Your child needs a lot of rest. Let them sleep more or just relax at home. They don't have to do too many things right now.
Belly Massage: Gently rub your child's belly if it helps with the pain. Do this in a circle, going around the belly button.
Warmth: A warm bath or a heating pad on the tummy might make them feel better. Just be careful not to make it too hot!
Food and Drink:
4. Drink Lots: Your child needs to drink plenty of water. This helps their body heal.

Soft Foods: Start with easy-to-eat foods like soup, applesauce, or toast. If your child feels good after eating these, they can slowly start eating their regular foods.
Medicine:
6. Pain Relief: If the doctor said it's okay, you can give your child over-the-counter medicine, like Children's Tylenol, for pain. Make sure to follow the instructions on the box.

Medicine from Doctor: If the doctor gave your child special medicine, make sure your child takes it exactly as the doctor said.
When to Get Help:
8. Worse Pain: If your child's tummy pain gets worse or doesn't get better in a few days, call your doctor.

New Problems: Call your doctor right away if your child has new problems, like throwing up, fever, or they can't go to the bathroom.
Remember, you know your child best. If you feel like something isn't right, it's okay to call your doctor. They're there to help your child feel better.

Thank you for trusting us with your child's care. We wish your child a speedy recovery.

Yours sincerely,
