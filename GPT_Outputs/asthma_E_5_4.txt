Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Asthma

Dear Parents,

Your child has been treated for asthma. Asthma can't be cured, but with good care, it can be controlled so your child can live a healthy life. Here's how you can help:

1. Medicine:
Your child has two types of medicines:

Controller Medicine: This is taken every day, even when your child feels good. It helps to keep the airways in the lungs open and clear.

Rescue Medicine: This is used when your child has an asthma attack. It works fast to open the airways.

Always use the medicine as the doctor said. If you run out, get more right away. Don't stop the medicine without talking to the doctor.

2. Asthma Triggers:
Triggers are things that can start an asthma attack. They can be things like dust, smoke, pets, or getting a cold. Each child's triggers can be different. Keep your home clean, don't smoke, and keep pets away from your child's sleeping areas to help avoid triggers.

3. Asthma Action Plan:
The doctor has given you an Asthma Action Plan. This is a guide of what to do when your child has asthma symptoms. The plan is divided into three zones: Green (Go), Yellow (Caution), and Red (Emergency).

Green Zone: Your child is doing fine.
Yellow Zone: Your child may be getting sick. You may need to use the rescue medicine.
Red Zone: Your child needs help right away. Call the doctor or go to the hospital.
4. Watch for Signs:
Learn your child's asthma signs. These can be coughing, wheezing (a whistling sound when breathing), chest tightness, or trouble sleeping. If these happen, follow the Asthma Action Plan.

5. Check-Ups:
Take your child for regular check-ups. This lets the doctor see if the asthma plan is working and make changes if needed.

Remember:
If your child's symptoms get worse, or if the rescue medicine doesn't help, call the doctor or go to the emergency room right away.

You're doing a great job taking care of your child. Remember, you're not alone - your doctor is always there to help!
