Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Bronchiolitis

Dear Parents,

Your child has been diagnosed with bronchiolitis. This is an illness where the small air passages in the lungs, known as bronchioles, get inflamed and filled with mucus. This can make it harder for your child to breathe. It's common in kids under 2 years old, but can happen in older kids, too. It's usually caused by a virus, like the common cold or RSV (respiratory syncytial virus).

Here's how you can take care of your child at home:

Plenty of Fluids: Make sure your child drinks lots of fluids like water, juice, or soup. This keeps them hydrated and helps loosen the mucus in their lungs.

Rest: Your child needs to rest a lot. This helps their body fight the virus and get better.

Avoid Smoke: Don't smoke or let others smoke near your child. Smoke can make bronchiolitis worse.

Saline Drops: You can use saline (salt water) nose drops to help clear mucus from your child's nose.

Fever Relief: If your child has a fever, you can give them acetaminophen (like Tylenol) or ibuprofen (like Advil). Remember to follow the instructions on the box.

Monitor Breathing: Keep an eye on your child's breathing. If it gets faster, harder, or they seem to struggle, get help right away.

When to Get Help

If your child has any of these signs, call your doctor or get emergency help right away:

They're breathing very fast or look like they're working hard to breathe.
Their lips or face turn bluish or gray.
They're not drinking fluids or are having fewer wet diapers.
They're very sleepy or hard to wake up.
Remember, bronchiolitis is caused by a virus. So, antibiotics won't help because they only work on bacterial infections. Your child should start to get better in about a week or two. But, if your child's symptoms don't get better, or if they get worse, call your doctor right away.

Take care,
