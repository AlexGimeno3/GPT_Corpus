
Dear Parents,

Medications: If the doctor prescribed any medicine, give it as directed. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) can help bring down a fever, but only give these if your doctor says it's OK. Never give aspirin to a child as it can cause a serious condition called Reye's syndrome.

Hydration: Encourage your child to drink lots of fluids like water, soup, or juices. This helps to prevent dehydration caused by fever. For babies, continue with breast milk or formula.

Rest: It's important for your child to rest. This helps their body fight off the infection causing the fever.

Temperature Checks: Check your child's temperature every 4 hours. A normal temperature is below 100.4째F (38째C).

Comfort: Dress your child lightly. Overdressing can trap body heat and make the fever last longer. You can also use a damp, cool cloth on your child's forehead while they're resting.

Follow-up: Schedule a follow-up visit with the doctor if the fever lasts more than 2 days, gets worse, or if new symptoms occur.

When to seek immediate medical help:

If your child:

Has a fever over 104째F (40째C)
Seems very sick, unusually sleepy or very fussy
Has trouble breathing
Has a rash, especially one that doesn't fade when you press on it
Shows signs of dehydration like dry lips, no tears when crying, going a long time without peeing, or acting really tired or cranky
Remember, fever is the body's way of fighting infection. It's a symptom, not a disease. It's OK to treat it, but it's more important to know what's causing it. If you're not sure, always call the doctor.

Take care, and let's keep your kiddo healthy!
