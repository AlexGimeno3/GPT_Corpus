Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Bronchiolitis

Dear Parent(s) or Guardian(s),

Your child has been diagnosed with bronchiolitis, a lung infection that causes inflammation and mucus to build up in the tiny airways (bronchioles) of the lungs. It's most common in babies and young children. Here's what you need to know:

Medication: Give your child any prescribed medication as directed by your doctor. Always complete the full course of medicine, even if your child seems better.

Rest and Hydration: Ensure your child gets plenty of rest. Keep them well-hydrated with fluids such as water, diluted fruit juice, or oral rehydration solutions.

Feeding: Small, frequent meals may be easier for your child. If you are breastfeeding, continue to do so.

Fever Management: If your child has a fever, you can use over-the-counter medicine such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Always follow the instructions on the bottle for the correct dose.

Humidity: Use a cool-mist humidifier in your child's room to help make breathing easier. Remember to clean it often to prevent mold buildup.

Avoid Smoke Exposure: Do not smoke or allow smoking around your child. This can make symptoms worse.

Monitor Symptoms: Pay attention to your child's symptoms. If they get worse, return to the doctor right away.

Call your doctor or go to the emergency room if your child:

Has trouble breathing or is breathing very fast.
Cannot drink fluids or is not wetting diapers as usual.
Is very sleepy or hard to wake up.
Has a bluish color around the lips, tongue, or face.
Remember, bronchiolitis can take 2-3 weeks to get better. The cough may linger even longer. It's important to keep follow-up appointments with your pediatrician to ensure your child is improving.
