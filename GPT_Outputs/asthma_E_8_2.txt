Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Asthma

Dear Parent or Guardian,

Your child has been diagnosed with asthma, a condition that affects the airways in the lungs. Here are key instructions to manage your child's asthma at home:

1. Medicine:
Your child has been prescribed two types of medicine:

Quick-relief inhaler (Albuterol): This is used to stop asthma attacks. Use this medicine when your child shows signs of an attack like coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, or trouble breathing.
Long-term control medicine (like inhaled corticosteroids): This should be used every day, even if your child feels fine. It helps keep asthma attacks from happening.
2. Inhaler Use:
Use the inhaler correctly:

Remove the cap and shake well.
Have your child breathe out all the way.
Put the inhaler in or near the mouth. If using a spacer, attach it to the inhaler and have your child breathe in slowly.
Press the inhaler to release medicine as your child starts to breathe in.
Have your child hold their breath for 10 seconds, then breathe out slowly.
3. Asthma Action Plan:
Follow the plan provided by your child's doctor. This includes when and how to use the medicines, how to avoid triggers, and what to do during an asthma attack.

4. Avoid Triggers:
Triggers are things that can cause an asthma attack. These may include dust, smoke, pets, pollen, or cold weather. Keep your home clean, don't smoke around your child, and try to keep them indoors when pollen counts are high.

5. Watch for Symptoms:
Keep an eye on symptoms that could mean your child's asthma is getting worse, such as needing to use their quick-relief inhaler more often. If this happens, contact the doctor.

6. Follow-Up Care:
Make sure to follow up with your child's doctor in 1-2 weeks, or sooner if your child's symptoms get worse.

When to Seek Emergency Care:
Take your child to the Emergency Department if they:

Have trouble speaking or walking due to difficulty breathing.
Are using their quick-relief medicine, but it's not helping.
Have bluish lips or face.
Remember, asthma can be well-managed with the right care and attention. Follow these instructions and always reach out to your child's doctor if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,
