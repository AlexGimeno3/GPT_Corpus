Dear Parents/Guardians,

Your child has been diagnosed with asthma, a condition that can make it hard for them to breathe. But don't worry, with proper care and attention, they can lead a normal and active life. Here are some instructions to manage your child's asthma at home:

Medications: Your child will have two types of medicines:

Controller Medicines: These should be taken every day to prevent asthma symptoms, even when your child feels fine.
Rescue Medicines: These should be used when your child has an asthma attack or sudden difficulty breathing. It is important to carry the rescue medicine at all times.
Asthma Action Plan: Always follow the asthma action plan given by your child's doctor. It tells you which medicine to give, how much, when, and what to do during an asthma attack.

Triggers: Identify what triggers your child's asthma, like dust, smoke, or certain foods. Keep your home clean, avoid smoking indoors, and monitor for food allergies.

Exercise: Regular physical activity is important but should be moderated according to your child's condition. If exercise triggers asthma, give the rescue medicine before any strenuous activity.

Stay Calm: Asthma can be scary, but staying calm helps your child breathe more easily. Teach them to relax and take slow, deep breaths during an attack.

Follow-up Visits: Regular check-ups with your child's doctor are crucial to managing their asthma. Don't miss any appointments.

Emergency Care: If your child's symptoms worsen, or they cannot speak, eat or sleep because of difficulty in breathing, get medical help immediately.

Remember, asthma can be managed with your care and attention. Educate your child about their condition, and encourage them to be open about their symptoms. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to your child's healthcare team. We are here to help.
