Your child has been diagnosed with bronchiolitis. This is an infection that causes the tiny airways in the lungs to swell, making it hard for your child to breathe. Here's how you can help them feel better at home:

Medicine:

The doctor may have given you medicine. Always give it just as the doctor said. Don't give more or less without talking to the doctor first.
Do not use cough or cold medicine unless the doctor says it's okay. These might not be safe for kids under 4 years old.
Breathing:

Use a cool-mist humidifier in your child's room. This helps keep their airways moist and makes it easier to breathe. Make sure to clean the humidifier regularly.
If your child's nose is stuffed, use saline (saltwater) nose drops. Then use a bulb syringe to gently suction out the mucus.
Avoid smoke, including cigarette smoke, which can make your child's symptoms worse. Keep your child's environment smoke-free.
Fluids and Rest:

Make sure your child gets plenty of rest. This will help their body fight the infection.
Keep your child well hydrated. Offer small amounts of fluids often. For babies, this might mean breastfeeding or bottle-feeding more frequently. For older kids, water and juice are good options.
When to Get Help:
Call the doctor right away if your child:

Is breathing fast or having trouble breathing.
Has a blue color around the lips, tongue, or nails.
Is not eating or drinking, or has fewer wet diapers than usual.
Is very sleepy or hard to wake up.
Has a high fever or a fever that lasts more than a few days.
Prevention:
Bronchiolitis is often caused by a virus, and it spreads easily. To prevent the spread:

Wash your hands and your child's hands often.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Clean toys and surfaces regularly.
Follow-Up:
Make sure to go to all follow-up appointments with the doctor. These visits allow the doctor to see how your child is doing and make changes to the treatment if needed.

Remember, it's very important to follow all these instructions and keep in touch with the doctor. We want your child to get better as soon as possible! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call your child's doctor.
