
Instructions for Taking Care of Your Child After Diarrhea and Vomiting

Dear Parent,

Your child has been treated for diarrhea and vomiting, and now it's important for you to follow these steps at home:

1. Keep Your Child Hydrated:
Hydration is vital. Diarrhea and vomiting cause a loss of fluids, which can lead to dehydration. Offer small sips of water, oral rehydration solutions like Pedialyte, or ice chips every 15 minutes. Avoid giving fruit juices, soda, or sports drinks, which can make diarrhea worse.

2. Feed Your Child Appropriately:
Start with bland, easy-to-digest foods once your child is ready to eat. Examples include bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (BRAT diet). As they feel better, slowly reintroduce their regular diet.

3. Monitor for Signs of Dehydration:
Look out for signs of dehydration, including dry mouth, crying without tears, excessive sleepiness, sunken eyes, and fewer wet diapers. If your child shows these signs, contact your doctor immediately.

4. Wash Hands Frequently:
Keep germs from spreading by washing hands often, especially after changing diapers and before preparing food. Use warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds.

5. Rest:
Let your child rest. Sleep is important for their recovery.

6. Avoid Certain Foods:
Stay away from fatty, spicy, or hard-to-digest foods until the diarrhea subsides.

7. Follow Medication Instructions:
If your doctor prescribed any medications, make sure to use them exactly as directed. Never give your child medication intended for adults or older children.

8. Follow-Up Appointment:
Make sure to attend any scheduled follow-up appointments with your child's doctor. They will check on your child's recovery and answer any questions you have.

Remember, this guide is just a start. If your child’s condition gets worse or they show signs of dehydration, call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room. Trust your instincts—you know your child best.

Thank you for taking the time to read these instructions. Your child's health and wellbeing are our top priority.

Take care,
